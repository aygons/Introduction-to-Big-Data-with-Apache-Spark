# Introduction-to-Big-Data-with-Apache-Spark
BerkeleyX -  CS100.1x

This a very good introductory course for Spark but requires a bit background on Python. I started late so 20% of the scores were deducted for `setup` and `lab 1`. `Lab 3` is one of best practice I have ever done. Highly recommend for anyone whoâ€™s interested in PySpark.

The course is closed so I uploaded all the codes for record/reference purpose. Please don't upload to autograder.
