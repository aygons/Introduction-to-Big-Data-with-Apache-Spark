# Introduction-to-Big-Data-with-Apache-Spark
BerkeleyX -  CS100.1x

This a very good introductory course for Spark but requires a bit background on Python. I started late so 20% of the scores were deducted for `setup` and `lab 1`. `Lab 3` is one of best practice I have ever done. Highly recommend for anyone who’s interested in PySpark.

The course is closed so I uploaded all the codes for record/reference purpose. Please don't upload to autograder.

Lab content summary:

1. `Lab 0`: VM setup
2. `Lab 1`: learn about the Spark data model, transformations, and actions, and write a word counting program to count the words in all of Shakespeare's plays
3. `Lab 2`: use Spark to explore a NASA Apache web server log in the second course lab 
4. `Lab 3`: perform text analysis and entity resolution on Google and Amazon product listings using Spark. `TF-IDF` is implemented .
5. `Lab 4`: use Spark's `mllib` Machine Learning library to perform collaborative filtering on a movie dataset in the fourth course lab
